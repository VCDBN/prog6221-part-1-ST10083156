##Recipe App

Created to allow users to input a single recipe into the program and display it, change and adjust quantities of ingredients as well as clear recipe and re-enter a new one

##Application usage

The application is coded in the C# language, on Visual Studio 2022.
If the app is not downloaded on your computer then you will need to download it to run this app. 


##Code functionality

The app persists the data entered only while active, meaning the recipe does not get stored in memory when the application is deactivated.
